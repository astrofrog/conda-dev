    - pyqt >=5.6

  run:

    # The following is needed to make sure that the package works as a GUI
    # application (glue needs to be run with python.app, not python)
    - python.app  # [osx]

    # Required dependencies
    - python
    - numpy >=1.9
    - pandas >=0.14

    # so we add it here for now
    - dask

    # For some reason, when on Windows with Python 2.7, conda tries to install
    # an older version of PyQt5 with sip 4.19 which causes issues

    - glue.core
    - glue.app.qt
  commands:
    - glue --version
    - glue-deps list

# NOTE: we deliberatey do NOT include an app entry here, because we instead do this
# in the glueviz meta-package (we don't want glue to appear twice in the navigator)
